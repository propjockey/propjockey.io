    <h2>I'm Jane.</h2>

    <p>I make things that help people make things.</p>
    <p>
      I've held many web-related job titles from "Developer &amp; Designer" to "Senior Software Engineer", but at the end of the day
      it's always included fullstack engineering with a bit of styling.<br>
      The backend is usually something layered on Node and an ORM, but it's been a wide range from PHP and MySQL, to ColdFusion and TSQL, to FeathersJS and MongoDB.
    </p>
    <p>I've given talks on security, character encoding, and mixing WebGL with a web component framework.</p>
    <p>I've taught people Regular Expressions and written more parsers than I can remember.</p>
    <p>At the end of the day though, what I enjoy most is UX Engineering.</p>

    <h2>Whys and hows.</h2>
    <p>
      My first dive into programming was learning how to hack Nintendo 64 games.<br>
      Step 1 of that was learning hexadecimal and binary.
      Eventually game hacking evolved to writing PowerPC Assembly scripts for the relatively advanced work.<br>
      From there, I wound up creating the number one site for Nintendo Wii game hackers to share their work. I've since taken it offline, but it was a trip.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three important characteristics grew from that background though:<br>
      <span>1.</span> I started in the binary &amp; assembly and worked my way up; I default to thinking about programming and efficiency at the lowest level.<br>
      <br>
      <span>2.</span> I don't interact with anything without a background thought constantly churning up ideas on how to improve it or make it more fun;
      I have specific UserScripts for almost every site I visit regularly, and even one that runs on every single site.<br>
      <br>
      <span>3.</span> When I think about a code base or language spec, I automatically pick up on paths to exploit it.<br>
      Not maliciously, but just as a well-traveled map-like train-of-thought from continually keeping track &amp; jumping through
      literal pointers in RAM to reliably hit a target for a game hack.<br>
      If I put effort into it, thinking about exploiting something deliberately,
      I wind up discovering something like the CSS Space Toggle and sharing it with everyone I can reach.

    <h2>Contact Me</h2>
    <p>
      My twitter DMs are open but they don't ping me if I'm not following, so it may be a few days until I notice.<br>
      <a href="http://jane.propjockey.io/">~ My Twitter ~</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm also on Discord if you want to contact me more urgently: <span>Jane#0420</span>
    </p>
    <br>
    <aside>
      ...istg, I didn't choose 420, it chose me:<br>
      <img src="/assets/welp.png" alt="screenshot of a dev console with consecutive error responses followed by a success response">
      I wanted to change my Discord name to "Jane" and every # tag I tried was taken,
      they don't have a way to "just take any # with my name" (unless you stop paying?!?!)
      so I wrote a script to try, wait, increment, loop and it succeeded... on 420. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
